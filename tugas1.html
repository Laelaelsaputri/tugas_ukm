	<h1 style="color: blue"><b>A Brief History of HTML</b></h1>
	<h2 style="color: blue">1993-Present</h2>
	<p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Bernes-Lee in 1993. Since then,there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widly use version throughout the 2000's was <b>HTML 4.01</b>. which became an official standard in December 1999.<br></p>
	<p>Another version,<b>XHTML</b>,was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language.XML is a standard markup languange that is used to create oter markup languages. Huandreds <i><b>MathML, MusicML</b></i> and <i><b>RSS</b></i> (Really Simple Synadication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language(XML),their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very pwerful, and it's n suprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML(again,calles XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000,and was update in 2002.XHTML is vary similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML language, because without it, interoperability between HTML and XHTML in <a href="unit 2">unit 2</a>.</p>

Therefore,<b>HTML5 is the primary language taught in this course</b></p>

	<p>The folloeing table shows a list of many of the types of content that can be added to web pages using different versions of HTML. in the early days of the Web, HTML(version 1.2/0) was very simple, but over time new verions were released that added more and more features. Stiil, if web designers wantes to add content of features that HTML didn't support, thay wuld have t do do with non-stanard proprietary technologies suuch as Adobe Flash. There technologies would require users to install browser plug-ins, and in some cases meant that certain users would be unable to access the content(for example, iPhones and iPads don't support</p>
